## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Getting Started

The starter code implements the general structure that we reviewed in lecture.  After cloning your repository, you will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder in your directory and download all the dependencies needed to run the project.  Note that this folder is `.gitignore` file and should not be committed to your repository.  After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

The build system should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Rubric

Graded out of 20 points.

## Wizard Bonus Challenge

All of the assignments in the course will include great opportunities for students to go beyond the requirements of the assignment and do cool extra work. On each assignment, you can earn **one bonus point** for implementing a meaningful new feature to your program. This should involve some original new programming, and should not just be something that can be quickly implemented by copying and slightly modifying existing code.  

There are great opportunities for extra work in this assignment. For example:

## Submission

When you commit and push your assignment to GitHub, an automated script will build and deploy the production code to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.  However, your submission is not complete until you do the following:

1. Open your repository on GitHub and go to Settings->Pages.
2. Change the source to the `gh-pages` branch, then save.

You will need to wait a few minutes for the website to deploy.  After that, make sure to test everything by pointing your web browser at the link generated for your build:

```
https://csci-4611-spring-2022.github.io/your-repo-name-here
```

If your program runs correctly, then you are finished!  The published build will indicate to the TAs that your assignment is ready for grading.  If you change your mind and want to make further changes to your code, then just delete the `gh-pages` branch and set the GitHub pages source back to `None`, and it will unpublish the website.

Note that the published JavaScript bundle code generated by the TypeScript compiler has been minified so that it is not human-readable. So, you can feel free to send this link to other students, friends, and family to show off your work!
